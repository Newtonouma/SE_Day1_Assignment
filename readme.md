            #Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering


1. Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry. 
- Software Engineering is the practice of designing, developing, and maintaining software systems through writing code and building applications that solve real-world problems
- It ensures the development of reliable, scalable, and secure software solutions that meet user needs and business goals.

2. Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.  
- The development of programming languages 
- The establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s
- The advent of structured programming in the 1970s
- The rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s.

3. List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
  - Requirements: Gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
  - Design: Creating high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
  - Implementation: Writing code and building the software according to the design specifications.
  - Testing: Conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
  - Deployment: Releasing the software to users or customers.
  - Maintenance: Providing ongoing support, updates, and enhancements to the software after deployment.

4. Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
  - Agile: Iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration, and responding to change
  - Waterfall: Sequential approach with distinct phases (e.g., requirements, design, implementation) flowing downwards like a waterfall.

5. Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
  - Software Developer.
  - Quality Assurance Engineer.
  - Project Manager.
  - System Architect.
  - UI/UX Designer.

6. Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
  - Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging, and testing code e.g. Pycharm.
  - Version Control Systems (VCS) used for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members e.g. Git.

7. What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
  - Changing Requirements.
    - strategy
      -Use iterative development processes like Agile, which allows for frequent feedback and flexibility in adapting to changing requirements.  
  - Tight Deadlines.
     - strategy
       - Break down the project into smaller, manageable tasks and prioritize critical features or functionalities that must be delivered first.

8. Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
  - Unit Testing: Testing individual components or modules of software.
     - Importance
         - Unit testing focuses on testing individual components or modules in isolation
  - Integration Testing: Testing interactions between different components or subsystems.
     - Importance
         - Integration testing verifies that different components or subsystems work together as intended.  
  - System Testing: Testing the entire software system as a whole.
     - Importance
         - System testing evaluates the entire software system as a whole, ensuring it functions as expected in a real-world environment.
  - Acceptance Testing: Testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.
     - Importance
         - Acceptance testing checks whether the software meets the userâ€™s requirements and expectations.
       

                #Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

1. Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
    Prompt engineering is the practice of designing and refining input prompts to effectively communicate with AI models, ensuring they produce the desired output. It is important because the quality of the prompts directly influences the model's accuracy, relevance, and ability to generate meaningful and contextually appropriate responses.

2. Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
   - Vague Prompt: "Tell me about programming."
   - Improved Prompt: "Explain the key differences between object-oriented programming and functional programming, with examples."
